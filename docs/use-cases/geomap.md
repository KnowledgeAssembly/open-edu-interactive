# GeoMap engine — use-case catalog

**Status:** Active (P8 Workstream A — slice honesty)  
**Engine:** `geomap` (`packages/geomap-engine`)  
**Contract:** `docs/engines/geomap/SPEC.md`  
**Vision:** `docs/engines/geomap/VISION.md`

## How to read this document

Each use case is a **lesson archetype**. Implementers ship fixtures that match acceptance criteria; authors and agents copy those fixtures, not abstract prop grids.

Use cases are grouped by **layer type** (`region`, `marker`, `route`). Stable scene node ids follow `geom-{layerId}-{entityId}` (e.g. `geom-states-odisha`).

**D7 boundary (always):**

| Layer | Owns |
|-------|------|
| **Engine** | Geography, scene, SVG, semantic targets, D5 `select` / `focus` / `deselect` / `reset`, snapshot, alternative entity list |
| **OpenEdu host** | Prompt text, answer key, correct/incorrect feedback, hints, progression, scoring, citation UI |

---

## Interaction modes by layer type

| Mode | Layer | Authoring signal | Learner experience | Engine events |
|------|-------|------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| **display** | region, marker, route | `interactive: false` on layer items (or layer `visible: false`) | Geography is visible; no pointer targets on that layer | — |
| **guided-select** | region, marker | Exactly one (or few) items with `interactive: true`; peers `interactive: false` | Learner taps the prompted place; only valid targets accept input | `geomap.entity-selected` |
| **discovery-select** | region, marker | Multiple items with `interactive: true` | Learner finds the correct entity among several choices | `geomap.entity-selected` |
| **explore** | region, marker (multi-layer) | `interaction.mode: "explore"`; broad `interactive: true` coverage | Free exploration; no single correct answer enforced by engine | `geomap.entity-selected`, `geomap.entity-focused` |
| **focus** | region, marker | `focus` in `interaction.actions` | Keyboard / programmatic emphasis without changing selection | `geomap.entity-focused` |
| **trace** *(planned)* | route | Route layer with `path`; step/play actions | Learner follows a path in order | `geomap.route-step` *(planned)* |
| **filter** *(planned)* | region, marker | `filter` in `interaction.actions`; category metadata on entities | Learner narrows visible entities by attribute | `geomap.filter-applied` *(planned)* |
| **attribute-view** *(planned)* | region, marker | Data-driven fill/size from an authored `measure` per entity (semantic encoding, never raw colors) | Learner reads a theme distribution (rainfall, density, forest cover) | `geomap.theme-view` *(planned)* |
| **overlay-compare** *(planned)* | any | Two or more layers toggled or shown together | Learner relates two themes (rainfall ↔ vegetation) | `geomap.layer-toggled` *(planned)* |
| **construct-mark** *(planned)* | region, marker, route | `mark` construct action on a blank basemap layer | Learner places/labels a feature on a blank map (board-style map skill) | namespaced `geomap.*` result event *(planned)* |

**Node id convention:** `geom-{layerId}-{entityId}` for region and marker items; route nodes use `geom-{layerId}-{routeId}` with segment children `geom-{layerId}-{routeId}-seg-{i}`.

## NIOS course-building catalog

**Purpose.** Scenarios for building NIOS geography and social-science courses at OBE (primary), Secondary (213), and Senior Secondary (316) levels. Map content below is **generic placeholder** — any board or region can adopt it; the host must supply real data with `sources[]` (P9). Levels: `OBE-A` (≈classes 1–2), `OBE-B` (≈3–5), `OBE-C` (≈6–8), `SEC` (≈10), `SR` (≈12).

**Reading order:** use-case template and mode definitions in `docs/use-cases/README.md` and the sections above. Every case below is `planned` — it names a learner scenario first; a fixture and `New capability` land only when scheduled in PLAN-P8 Workstream A.

### Syllabus mapping

| Level | Subject | Map-relevant module | Typical topics |
|---|---|---|---|
| OBE-A | Environmental Studies | Locality and neighbourhood | home→school route, landmarks, directions, water bodies |
| OBE-B | Environmental Studies | Our India, land and water | states/capitals, major rivers, landforms, seasons |
| OBE-C | Environmental Studies | Physical setting of India | physiographic divisions, climate, vegetation |
| SEC | Social Science (213) | Module 1 (history) | national movement and colonial-era places |
| SEC | Social Science (213) | Module 2, L9–L14 | physiography, climate, biodiversity, agriculture, transport, population; board map skill (~8 marks) |
| SR | Geography (316) | Module VI | physical setting, climate, natural disasters |

| **Prompt** *(host)* | “Tap the river that flows through the northern plain and empties into the eastern sea.” |
| **Action** | Select the river’s line; `focus` its source, then its mouth. |
| **Acceptance** | The river renders as a selectable line with named source/mouth markers; selection emits `geomap.entity-selected` with the feature record; alternative lists source and mouth. |
| **Spec** | A `line` layer (or interactive `route` items) with `items[].label`; source/mouth as `marker` sub-entities. |
| **Fixture** | `nios/loc-linear-feature` *(planned)* |
| **New capability** | `linear-feature` — today `route` items are display-only; rivers/roads need selectable line targets. |
| **Host** | Answer key: the named river. |
| **Status** | `planned` |

### `gm-loc-2-multi-locate` — Label a whole map in sequence (board-skill preparation)

| Field | Value |

|-------|-------|
| **Learner** | OBE-B / SEC: matches a legend entry (peak, shrine, port) with the feature it describes. |
| **Prompt** *(host)* | “Tap the legend row for ‘mountain peak’, then tap the peak itself.” |
| **Action** | Select a legend row (emphasis on matching entities), then `select` the matching feature; `reset` between pairings. |
| **Acceptance** | Choosing a legend row highlights, but does not select, matching entities; feature selection emits `geomap.entity-selected`; alternative pairs each symbol with its meaning. |
| **Spec** | Legend items with `role`/symbol metadata; legend↔entity link ids. |
| **Fixture** | `nios/leg-match-symbol` *(planned)* |
| **New capability** | `legend-link` — legend selection must drive scene emphasis without changing selection state. |
| **Host** | Pairing rubric; symbol names localizable. |
| **Status** | `planned` |

### `gm-leg-2-identify-symbol` — Name the feature a symbol stands for (display)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Learner** | OBE-A / OBE-B: reads the legend and tells what a symbol means. |
| **Prompt** *(host)* | “What does this legend symbol stand for?” (host binds a legend row to `focus`) |
| **Action** | `focus` the legend row; no selection required. |
| **Acceptance** | `geomap.entity-focused` carries the legend row record; alternative exposes the symbol caption for screen readers. |
| **Spec** | Legend rows as focusable semantic targets (display mode). |
| **Fixture** | `nios/leg-identify-symbol` *(planned)* |
| **Host** | Text/numeric answer check. |

| **Prompt** *(host)* | “Tap the feature that lies to the east of the school.” |
| **Action** | Discovery select among candidates; `focus` for keyboard exploration. |
| **Acceptance** | A compass rose (or host chrome) is visible; selection id identifies the correct entity; alternative lists each feature with its bearing from the reference point. |
| **Spec** | Compass node on scene (or host chrome); `interaction.mode: "explore"` optional. |
| **Fixture** | `nios/nav-follow-compass` *(planned)* |
| **Host** | Answer key per bearing; hints degrade gracefully (N→E→SE). |
| **Status** | `planned` |

### `gm-nav-2-locate-in-region` — Which region contains this point?

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Learner** | OBE-C / SEC: places a point feature (city, dam) and names the region that contains it. |
| **Prompt** *(host)* | “The dam lies inside which region?” |
| **Action** | Select the containing region; `focus` the point first as a cue. |
| **Acceptance** | Point and region compose in one scene; selection of the region emits `geomap.entity-selected`; alternative lists the point under its containing region. |

| **Learner** | SEC / SR: reads a linear scale and estimates the straight-line distance between two given points. |
| **Prompt** *(host)* | “About how far is City A from City B?” |
| **Action** | `focus` both markers, then `answer` a numeric estimate in the host. |
| **Acceptance** | A linear-scale node is rendered and labelled; the alternative or host provides the reference distance; nothing measures precise pixels. |
| **Spec** | `scale-bar` scene node; `viewport.fit` ensures a stable scale. |
| **Fixture** | `nios/scale-estimate-distance` *(planned)* |
| **New capability** | `scale-bar` — no scale/distances exist in the current snapshot. |
| **Host** | Tolerance band on the estimate; feedback on units. |
| **Status** | `planned` |

### `gm-scale-2-nearest` — Which of two places is nearer to X?

| Field | Value |

|-------|-------|
| **Learner** | SEC: works out the neighbours of a shaded region. |
| **Prompt** *(host)* | “Name the regions that border Region R1.” |
| **Action** | Discovery-select each neighbour; `reset` between picks; the shaded target is display-only emphasis. |
| **Acceptance** | The target is emphasised without being selectable; each neighbour selection emits `geomap.entity-selected`; alternative lists every region with its adjacent neighbours. |
| **Spec** | Region layer with mixed `interactive` flags; alternative exposes adjacency when `adjacency` lands. |
| **Fixture** | `nios/dir-borders` *(planned)* |
| **New capability** | `adjacency` — the alternative today lists entities, not neighbour sets. |
| **Host** | Answer set = adjacency list. |
| **Status** | `planned` |

### `gm-dir-2-north-of` — What lies to the north?

| Field | Value |

| **Prompt** *(host)* | “Which region receives the highest rainfall?” |
| **Action** | Discovery select the correct region among shaded candidates. |
| **Acceptance** | Region fills encode an authored `measure` deterministically (semantic encoding); selection payload includes the measure value; a legend explains buckets; nothing relies on colour alone (P6). |
| **Spec** | `style.by` / `measure` on region items; `attr-encoding` capability. |
| **Fixture** | `nios/dist-theme-identify` *(planned)* |
| **New capability** | `attr-encoding` — current `style.role` is a closed semantic-token set, not data-driven. |
| **Host** | Answer key: max row id + value. |
| **Status** | `planned` |

### `gm-dist-2-theme-explore` — Explore a theme’s spatial pattern

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Learner** | SR: explores the pattern of a theme before a discussion (e.g. “Where is forest cover highest and why?”). |

| **Status** | `planned` |

### `gm-dist-3-filter-category` — Narrow a map by category

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Learner** | SEC / SR: filters a busy map to one category (coastal states, rain-fed districts, mining belts). |
| **Prompt** *(host)* | “Show only the coastal regions.” |
| **Action** | Host dispatches `filter` with category ids; learner then selects within the subset. |
| **Acceptance** | Non-matching regions are hidden or de-emphasised; `geomap.filter-applied` in the event log; `clear-filter` restores the full map. |
| **Spec** | `interaction.actions` includes `filter`, `clear-filter`; category metadata on entities. |
| **Fixture** | `nios/dist-filter-category` *(planned)* |
| **New capability** | `filter-category` (extends planned `gm-r4-filter-regions` semantics). |
| **Host** | Filter control labels. |
| **Status** | `planned` |

### `gm-dist-4-graduated-marker` — Read a scaled-marker map (city population)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Learner** | SEC / SR: reads city size off marker size, not a table. |
| **Prompt** *(host)* | “Which city has the largest population in this region?” |
| **Action** | Discovery select the largest marker. |
| **Acceptance** | Marker radius encodes a measure deterministically; legend ties size buckets to values; payload includes the population value; alternative lists values textually. |
| **Spec** | `marker.size.by` / `attr-encoding` on marker items. |
| **Fixture** | `nios/dist-graduated-marker` *(planned)* |
| **New capability** | `attr-encoding` (marker sizing). |

| **Prompt** *(host)* | “Which region has more rainfall: Region A or Region B?” |
| **Action** | Discovery select between two candidates. |
| **Acceptance** | Both candidates visible and comparable; selection payload carries each measure value; alternative lists both values. |
| **Spec** | Two region items with authored `measure` values. |
| **Fixture** | `nios/cmp-which-more` *(planned)* |
| **Host** | Answer key; “both” tolerated when values tie. |

### `gm-cmp-2-density-max-min` — Find the densest and sparsest region (SR)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Learner** | SR (Module IX): works a population-density theme map. |
| **Prompt** *(host)* | “Tap the most densely populated region.” |
| **Action** | Discovery select; a second step asks for the least dense. |

## Contract changes (proposed by the NIOS catalog)

The `done` slice is expressible with the current surface (`region` / `marker` / `route`, `interactive` per item, D5 `select` / `focus` / `deselect` / `reset`). The NIOS catalog above **proposes** contract additions only where a catalogued use case fails acceptance without them (README rule — each entry names its use cases):

| Capability | Use cases that need it | Proposed contract surface |
|------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| `linear-feature` | `gm-loc-1-linear-feature`, `gm-move-2-trade-route`, `gm-move-3-transport-network` | Selectable line entities (rivers, roads, borders) beyond display-only `route` |
| `legend-link` | `gm-leg-1-match-symbol` | Legend row → scene-entity emphasis linkage |
| `adjacency` | `gm-dir-1-borders`, `gm-nav-2-locate-in-region` | Alternative list exposes shared borders / neighbour sets |
| `scale-bar` | `gm-scale-1-estimate-distance`, `gm-scale-2-nearest`, `gm-asm-1-board-map-skill` | Linear-scale node + distance estimate in snapshot |
| `attr-encoding` | `gm-dist-1…2`, `gm-dist-4`, `gm-cmp-1…2`, `gm-ovl-1…3`, `gm-mark-3`, `gm-inq-1`, `gm-asm-2` | Declarative data-driven region fill / marker size (semantic encoding, never raw colors — P2/P9) |
| `route-step` | `gm-move-1-trace-journey`, `gm-move-4-migration-patterns`, `gm-t2-trace-route` | Ordered path stepping; `geomap.route-step` result event |
| `period-slice` | `gm-hist-1-boundary-change`, `gm-hist-3-route-over-time` | Region/boundary sets keyed by period + shared `play-pause`/`scrub` |
| `layer-visibility` | `gm-ovl-1…3`, `gm-inq-1`, `gm-asm-3-verify-own-map` | Non-superseded per-layer toggle (e.g. `geomap.toggle-layer`) |
| `filter-category` | `gm-dist-3-filter-category`, `gm-r4-filter-regions`, `gm-move-3-transport-network` | Category metadata + `geomap.filter-applied` result event |
| `construct-mark` | `gm-mark-1…3`, `gm-inq-2-local-area`, `gm-asm-1-board-map-skill`, `gm-asm-3` | Construct `mark`/answer mode on blank basemap; learner-authored entities in snapshot |

Every proposal must land in `docs/engines/geomap/SPEC.md` (§7.x actions, §66 events) before implementation. Reconcile as well the **already-emitted-but-undocumented** events `geomap.entity-selected` / `geomap.entity-focused` in SPEC §66, and document the `geom-{layerId}-{entityId}` node-id convention.
