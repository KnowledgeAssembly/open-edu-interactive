# Diagram engine — use-case catalog

**Status:** Active (P8 Workstream A — slice honesty)  
**Engine:** `diagram` (`packages/diagram-engine`)  
**Contract:** `docs/engines/diagram/SPEC.md`  
**Vision:** `docs/engines/diagram/VISION.md`

## How to read this document

Each use case is a **lesson archetype**. Implementers ship fixtures that match acceptance criteria; authors and agents copy those fixtures, not abstract prop grids.

Use cases are grouped by **diagram kind** (`flow`, `cycle`, `hierarchy`, `concept-map`). Stable scene node ids follow `node-{nodeId}` for nodes and `edge-{from}-{to}` for edges (authored node ids also resolve in dispatch).

**D7 boundary (always):**

| Layer | Owns |
|-------|------|
| **Engine** | Graph model, auto-layout, scene, SVG, semantic targets, D5 `select` / `focus` / `follow` / `expand` / `collapse` / `reset`, snapshot, alternative relationship list |
| **OpenEdu host** | Prompt text, answer key, correct/incorrect feedback, hints, progression, scoring, cross-engine links via `nodes[].links` |

## Interaction modes by diagram kind

| Mode | Kind | Authoring signal | Learner experience | Engine events |
|------|------|------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| **display** | all | Host asks without requiring selection; diagram is reference | Learner reads structure from labels and layout | — |
| **guided-select** | all | Host prompt names one node; future per-node gating | Learner taps the prompted stage or concept | `diagram.node-selected` |
| **discovery-select** | all | All nodes visible; host scores on `nodeId` | Learner finds the correct node among candidates | `diagram.node-selected` |
| **explore** | all | `interaction.mode: "explore"` | Free exploration of nodes and relationships | `diagram.node-selected`, `diagram.node-focused`, `diagram.relationship-followed` |
| **follow** | all | `follow` in `interaction.actions` | Learner traces an authored edge | `diagram.relationship-followed` |
| **focus** | all | `focus` in `interaction.actions` | Keyboard / programmatic emphasis on a node | `diagram.node-focused` |
| **expand-collapse** | hierarchy | `contains` / `part-of` edges; `expand` / `collapse` in actions | Learner reveals or hides subtree children | — *(state change only; no bespoke event)* |
| **edge-select** *(planned)* | all | edge items `interactive: true` | Learner selects the edge itself to answer a relationship question | `diagram.edge-selected` *(planned)* |
| **multi-select** *(planned)* | concept-map | cumulative `select` set | Learner chooses every cause / effect, not just one | repeated `diagram.node-selected` |
| **relationship-gate** *(planned)* | all | edge labels hidden until answered | Learner recalls the relationship, then confirms on reveal | `diagram.relationship-followed` *(planned reveal)* |
| **construct** *(planned)* | all | shuffled candidates; `answer` arranges or declares | Learner builds the structure: an order, or edges between parts | namespaced `diagram.*` result *(planned)* |
| **filter-nodes** *(planned)* | all | D5 `filter` on node `category` metadata | Learner narrows a busy graph to a subset | `diagram.filter-applied` *(planned)* |
| **what-if** *(planned)* | all | pick a node to de-emphasise | Learner inspects consequence paths when a node is removed | `diagram.node-deemphasised` *(planned)* |

**Node id convention:** scene nodes use `node-{nodeId}`; edges use `edge-{from}-{to}` unless `edges[].id` is authored. Dispatch accepts either `node-{nodeId}` or the authored `nodeId`.

**Layout:** `layout.type` at envelope root (`radial` | `hierarchical` | `grid`) is a strategy selector — never author coordinates. Auto-layout positions are `positionSource: 'illustrative'` (DESIGN §9).

**Graph laws (enforced):** `flow` and `hierarchy` MUST be acyclic DAGs; `cycle` MUST contain ≥ 1 directed cycle; `concept-map` MAY contain cycles. Every edge MUST declare an explicit `relationship` — never infer causality from adjacency.

**Guided vs discovery (current slice):** every node and edge is `interactive: true` in the scene. Host distinguishes guided lessons by prompt and scores on `nodeId` / `relationship`. Per-node `interactive` gating is not implemented yet — propose in SPEC if two or more use cases require it.

## NIOS course-building catalog

Lesson archetypes for building NIOS courses — open schooling (OBE **primary**, **Secondary**, **Senior Secondary**) and any board that wants process / structure literacy. The engine reasons about **graph structure** (D7 — host owns prompt, answer key, feedback, hints, scoring); structure is the skill, topics are the content. All content below is placeholder-generic — swap any board's real topics in, keep the activity the same.

As with the GeoMap catalog, most cases reveal **contract gaps**. Marked `planned`; status flips to `done` when the engine and fixtures carry acceptance (exit gate, not intent).

### Syllabus mapping

| Level | Subject | Typical diagram topics | Cases |

| Assemble the structure | Arrange shuffled stages in the right order | construct | `construct-order` *(planned)* |
| Connect parts with a relation | Declare a relationship between two parts | construct | `construct-edge` *(planned)* |
| Label parts of a figure | Identify a named part of an illustration | `label-diagram` kind | `label-diagram` *(future kind)* |

### Group prefixes and new capabilities

| Group | Focus | Cases | New capability used |
|-------|-------|-------|---------------------|
| `di-proc-*` | Processes & sequences | 1–5 | `filter-nodes` |
| `di-cycl-*` | Natural & social cycles | 1–5 | `relation-vocab` (multi-path rock cycle) |
| `di-class-*` | Classification & hierarchy | 1–6 | `filter-nodes` |
| `di-cause-*` | Cause-effect concept maps | 1–6 | `multi-select`, `edge-select`, `relationship-gate`, `edge-weight`, `follow-chain` |
| `di-sys-*` | Systems & networks | 1–4 | `filter-nodes`, `relation-vocab` |
| `di-lab-*` | Label & annotate | 1–4 | `label-diagram`, `multi-select`, `construct-edge`, `relation-vocab` |

| `di-cmp-*` | Compare structures | 1–3 | `compare-layout`, `diff-emphasis` |
| `di-hist-*` | Historical processes & change | 1–4 | `links` vocabulary (`geomapEntityId`, `timelineEventId`) |
| `di-inq-*` | Inquiry & explanation | 1–3 | `what-if`, `follow-chain` |
| `di-asm-*` | Assessment | 1–3 | mixture (no new capability) |

### New capabilities in one line

- `edge-select` — edges become selectable targets ("which relationship connects A and B?") → planned `diagram.edge-selected`
- `multi-select` — cumulative selection set (all causes / all effects / all parts)
- `relationship-gate` — edge labels hidden until the learner commits an answer, then revealed
- `filter-nodes` — D5 `filter` on node `category` metadata → planned `diagram.filter-applied`
- `construct-order` — shuffled candidate nodes; learner arranges them into an order (construct answer)
- `construct-edge` — learner declares a relationship between two nodes, validated by graph laws
- `label-diagram` — the future diagram kind (`di-p1`): node → region-of-interest mapping
- `compare-layout` — two subgraph scenes rendered side-by-side under one layout strategy
- `diff-emphasis` — delta highlight between two authored structures
- `what-if` — non-destructive node de-emphasis (spec never mutated)
- `edge-weight` — semantic relative strength / influence metadata on edges (data, never style)
- `follow-chain` — per-step emphasis along a multi-edge path
- `relation-vocab` — extend the closed `relationship` enum with domain relations
- `links` vocabulary — extend `nodes[].links` beyond `visualEntityId` to `geomapEntityId`, `timelineEventId`

### Content rules

- **Generic placeholders:** every case keeps entities generic (`Kingdom → Phylum → Class`, `Chain A → Zone B`). The syllabus mapping names the *slot* a real course fills.
- **Structure before content (P1):** diagram-reading skill transfers across boards; topics do not. Keep the activity, swap the content.
- **Provenance (P9):** learner-facing entities must carry `sources[]` from host data; never invent relationships, kingdom branches, or boundaries absent from the data. `relationship` is never inferred from adjacency.

## Accessibility and data fidelity

### `di-a1-alternative-list` — Structured relationship list

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Learner** | Uses a table/list of nodes, edges, and cycles instead of the SVG diagram. |
| **Prompt** | — |
| **Action** | Host binds list row → `select` or `follow` dispatch |
| **Acceptance** | Alternative includes node rows, edge rows with non-empty `relationship`, and cycle rows for cyclic graphs; nothing conveyed by color or position alone (P6) |
| **Spec** | Any fixture with `accessibility.label` |
| **Fixture** | `packages/diagram-engine/fixture/water-cycle/` |
| **Host** | List presentation chrome |
| **Status** | `done` |

### `di-a2-validate-graph` — Reject invalid specs

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Learner** | — (authoring / validation) |
| **Prompt** | — |
| **Action** | — |
| **Acceptance** | Unknown `kind` → `INVALID_SPEC`; unknown `layout.type` (e.g. `force`) → `INVALID_SPEC`; unknown content/node keys → `INVALID_SPEC`; edge without `relationship` → schema failure; unknown node reference → `INVALID_REFERENCE`; self-loop → `INVALID_ENTITY`; empty `nodes[]` → `INVALID_SPEC` |
| **Spec** | Negative cases in unit tests + e2e `tryCreate` |
| **Fixture** | `packages/diagram-engine/test/validation.test.ts`, `packages/diagram-engine/e2e/diagram.spec.ts` |
| **Host** | — |
| **Status** | `done` |

## Future diagram kinds (SPEC — not in MVP slice)

### `di-p1-label-diagram` — Annotated figure with callouts

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Learner** | Grades 4–8: labels parts of a scientific illustration. |
| **Prompt** | Host: “Select the part that carries blood to the heart.” |
| **Action** | Select labelled node |
| **Acceptance** | `content.kind: "label-diagram"` (future enum value); nodes map to figure regions via `links` |
| **Spec** | Future kind; replaces legacy `science.label-diagram` widget |
| **Fixture** | `planned` |
| **Host** | Scoring + figure asset |
| **Status** | `planned` |

## Contract changes (proposed by the NIOS catalog)

The `done` slice is expressible on the current surface (`flow` / `cycle` / `hierarchy` / `concept-map`, explicit `relationship`, D5 `select` / `focus` / `follow` / `expand` / `collapse` / `reset`, alternative list). The NIOS catalog proposes additions only where a catalogued case fails acceptance without them — each row names its use cases:

| Capability | Use cases that need it | Proposed contract surface |
|------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| `multi-select` | `di-cause-1…2`, `di-lab-2`, `di-hist-3` | Cumulative selection set; set-scored dispatch |
| `edge-select` | `di-cause-3` | Edge items selectable; planned `diagram.edge-selected` |
| `relationship-gate` | `di-cause-6` | Edge labels hidden until `answer`; reveal then `follow` |
| `filter-nodes` | `di-proc-5`, `di-class-5`, `di-sys-1`, `di-sys-4` | D5 `filter` on node `category`; planned `diagram.filter-applied` |
| `construct-order` | `di-ord-1`, `di-ord-3` | Shuffled candidates + ordered `answer` (construct mode) |
| `construct-edge` | `di-lab-3`, `di-ord-3` | Learner-authored relationship edges, validated by graph laws |
| `label-diagram` | `di-lab-1…4` | Future kind (`di-p1`); node → region-of-interest mapping |
| `compare-layout` | `di-cmp-1`, `di-cmp-3` | Parallel scenes, same layout strategy |
| `diff-emphasis` | `di-cmp-2`, `di-cmp-3` | Delta highlight between authored structures |
| `what-if` | `di-inq-3` | Non-destructive node de-emphasis (spec never mutated) |
| `edge-weight` | `di-cause-5` | Semantic relative `strength` / influence metadata on edges |
| `relation-vocab` | `di-cycl-3`, `di-sys-1`, `di-lab-4` | Extend the closed `relationship` enum (`feeds-on`, `transforms-to`, `produces`, …) |
| `links` vocabulary | `di-hist-1…4`, `di-cmp-3` | `nodes[].links` beyond `visualEntityId`: `timelineEventId`, `geomapEntityId` |
| `follow-chain` | `di-cause-4` | Per-step emphasis along a multi-edge path |

Every proposal lands in `docs/engines/diagram/SPEC.md` (kinds & laws, actions, events) before implementation; the graph laws remain authoritative for validity. `kind: "label-diagram"` (`di-p1`) becomes the first future-kind gate to pull forward when `di-lab-*` demand is real.
