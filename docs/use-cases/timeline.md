# Timeline engine — use-case catalog

**Status:** Active (P8 Workstream A — slice honesty)  
**Engine:** `timeline` (`packages/timeline-engine`)  
**Contract:** `docs/engines/timeline/SPEC.md`  
**Vision:** `docs/engines/timeline/VISION.md`

## How to read this document

Each use case is a **lesson archetype**. Implementers ship fixtures that match acceptance criteria; authors and agents copy those fixtures, not abstract prop grids.

Use cases are grouped by **content slice** (`events` only, `events` + `periods`, `events` + `tracks`, integrated). Event marker ids are the authored `events[].id` values (e.g. `event-1947`).

**D7 boundary (always):**

| Layer | Owns |
|-------|------|
| **Engine** | Temporal model, layout, scene, SVG, semantic event markers, D5 `select` / `focus` / `play-pause` / `step` / `scrub` / `reset`, snapshot, linear alternative |
| **OpenEdu host** | Prompt text, answer key, correct/incorrect feedback, hints, progression, scoring, citations, cross-engine links via `events[].links` |

---

## Interaction modes

| Mode | Authoring signal | Learner experience | Engine events |
|------|------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| **display** | Host asks without requiring selection | Learner reads dates and order from the timeline | — |
| **guided-select** | Host prompt names one event | Learner taps the prompted marker | `timeline.event-selected` |
| **discovery-select** | All events visible; host scores on `eventId` | Learner finds the correct event among candidates | `timeline.event-selected` |
| **explore** | `interaction.mode: "explore"` | Free exploration of events | `timeline.event-selected`, `timeline.event-focused` |
| **focus** | `focus` in `interaction.actions` | Keyboard / programmatic emphasis on an event | `timeline.event-focused` |
| **playback** | `play-pause`, `step`, `scrub` in `interaction.actions` | Learner walks through events in chronological order | — *(updates `snapshot.step` / `snapshot.playback`; no `timeline.*` result event)* |
| **sequence-walk** | Host uses `step` or `scrub` between scored steps | Learner advances one event at a time through a lesson | — |

**Node id convention:** event markers use authored `events[].id`; period bands use `period-{periodId}` (display-only); track lanes use `track-{trackId}` (implicit default lane: `track-track-default`).

**Date grammar (Timeline-D3):** `^[+-]?\d{1,6}(-\d{2}){0,2}$` — e.g. `1857`, `1947-08-15`, `1919-04`. Invalid prose (`yesterday`) or out-of-range calendar dates are rejected.

**Temporal honesty:** never invent dates or durations. All values come from `content.events[].date` and `periods[].from` / `to`. Provenance `sources[]` is required. Chronological order does not imply causality (VISION).

**Guided vs discovery (current slice):** every event marker is `interactive: true`. Host distinguishes guided lessons by prompt and scores on `eventId`. Per-event `interactive` gating is not implemented yet — propose in SPEC if two or more use cases require it.

---

## Events-only (`content.events` — minimal slice)

Reference UX: chronological markers on a single axis. No periods or tracks.

### `tl-e1-explore-sequence` — Explore events in order (explore)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Learner** | Grades 4–7: explores two dated events on a timeline. |
| **Prompt** | Host: “What happened between 1900 and 1910?” |
| **Action** | Select or focus either event marker |
| **Acceptance** | Two `event-marker` nodes in date order; `select` → `timeline.event-selected` with `dateString` in payload; linear alternative lists both events |
| **Spec** | `content.kind: "events"`, `events[]` with Timeline-D3 dates |
| **Fixture** | `packages/timeline-engine/fixture/events/` |
| **Host** | Discussion |
| **Status** | `done` |

### `tl-e2-identify-earlier` — Which event came first? (discovery)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Learner** | Grades 5–8: selects the earlier of two events. |
| **Prompt** | Host: “Which happened first, Event A or Event B?” |
| **Action** | Tap `e1` (1900) |
| **Acceptance** | Layout places earlier date left of later; wrong selection still emits `timeline.event-selected` (host scores) |
| **Spec** | Same events-only model as `tl-e1-explore-sequence` |
| **Fixture** | `packages/timeline-engine/fixture/events/` |
| **Host** | Answer key: `e1` |
| **Status** | `done` |

### `tl-e3-read-date` — Read a date from the timeline (display)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Learner** | Grades 4–6: reads when Event B occurred from the marker label. |
| **Prompt** | Host: “In what year did Event B happen?” |
| **Action** | None required (oral or typed answer in host) |
| **Acceptance** | Marker label includes date (`1910`); linear alternative exposes exact `dateString` |
| **Spec** | `events[].label` + `events[].date` |
| **Fixture** | `packages/timeline-engine/fixture/events/` |
| **Host** | Answer key: `1910` |
| **Status** | `done` |

---

## Events with periods (`content.periods`)

Reference UX: shaded bands showing eras or regimes behind event markers. Period bands are display-only.

| **Fixture** | `packages/timeline-engine/fixture/periods/` |
| **Host** | Lesson framing |
| **Status** | `done` |

### `tl-p2-identify-period` — Which period contains an event? (discovery)

| **Prompt** | Host: “Was Event B in the First half or Second half?” |
| **Action** | Host scores oral answer or event selection as proxy |
| **Acceptance** | Period metadata `from`/`to` bracket event date; alternative list names periods with date ranges |
| **Spec** | Same periods model as `tl-p1-context-periods` |
| **Fixture** | `packages/timeline-engine/fixture/periods/` |
| **Host** | Answer key: `p2` (Second half) |
| **Status** | `done` |

### `tl-p3-reject-invalid-period` — Period from must not exceed to (validation)

| Field | Value |

| **Fixture** | `packages/timeline-engine/test/validation.test.ts` |
| **Host** | — |
| **Status** | `done` |

---

## Events with tracks (`content.tracks`)

Reference UX: parallel lanes for concurrent storylines. Each event belongs to exactly one track (or the implicit default lane).

### `tl-t1-parallel-lanes` — Compare parallel developments (explore)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Learner** | Grades 6–9: explores events on a named track alongside events on the default lane. |
| **Prompt** | Host: “What was happening on the First track at the same time as the default lane?” |
| **Action** | Select events on either lane |
| **Acceptance** | `track-t1` lane holds `e1` and `e2`; `e3` on `track-track-default`; no event in two tracks |
| **Spec** | `tracks[].events` lists event ids; membership validated |
| **Fixture** | `packages/timeline-engine/fixture/tracks/` |
| **Host** | Discussion |
| **Status** | `done` |

### `tl-t2-identify-track` — Which track contains an event? (discovery)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Learner** | Grades 6–9: identifies that Tracked A is on the First track. |
| **Prompt** | Host: “Which track is Tracked A on?” |
| **Action** | Select `e1` or answer from metadata |
| **Acceptance** | Event payload / metadata includes `trackId: "t1"` |
| **Spec** | Same tracks model as `tl-t1-parallel-lanes` |
| **Fixture** | `packages/timeline-engine/fixture/tracks/` |
| **Host** | Answer key: `t1` |
| **Status** | `done` |

### `tl-t3-reject-dup-membership` — Event cannot belong to two tracks (validation)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Learner** | — (authoring / validation) |
| **Prompt** | — |
| **Action** | — |
| **Acceptance** | Same `eventId` in two `tracks[].events` arrays → `INVALID_ENTITY` |
| **Spec** | Duplicate track membership |
| **Fixture** | `packages/timeline-engine/test/validation.test.ts`, `packages/timeline-engine/e2e/timeline.spec.ts` |
| **Host** | — |
| **Status** | `done` |

| **Action** | Select `event-1919` |
| **Acceptance** | Mixed granularity dates (`1857`, `1919-04-13`, `1947-08-15`) layout deterministically; marker labels include date strings |
| **Spec** | Timeline-D3 grammar at multiple precisions |
| **Fixture** | `packages/timeline-engine/fixture/independence/` |
| **Host** | Answer key: `event-1919` |
| **Status** | `done` |

## Accessibility and data fidelity

### `tl-a1-linear-alternative` — Linear ordered list

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Learner** | Uses a chronological list instead of the SVG timeline to review or select events. |
| **Prompt** | — |
| **Action** | Host binds list row → `select` dispatch |
| **Acceptance** | `snapshot.linear` (and harness `linear()`) lists events in chronological order with `kind` and `id`; nothing conveyed by position or color alone (P6) |
| **Spec** | Any fixture with `accessibility.label` |
| **Fixture** | `packages/timeline-engine/fixture/independence/` |
| **Host** | List presentation chrome |
| **Status** | `done` |

### `tl-a2-validate-temporal` — Reject invalid specs

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Learner** | — (authoring / validation) |
| **Prompt** | — |
| **Action** | — |
| **Acceptance** | Prose date (`yesterday`) → `INVALID_SPEC`/`INVALID_ENTITY`; out-of-range calendar (`1947-04-31`) → `INVALID_ENTITY`; unknown `content.kind` → `INVALID_SPEC`; missing `sources` → `INVALID_SPEC`; unknown track reference → `INVALID_REFERENCE`; duplicate track membership → `INVALID_ENTITY`; reserved id `track-default` → failure; event id colliding with generated `period-*` node → `INVALID_ENTITY`; strict schema rejects unknown keys |

## Contract changes (none proposed)

All `done` use cases are expressible with the current Timeline spec surface (`content.kind: "events"`, optional `periods` / `tracks`, Timeline-D3 dates, D5 `select` / `focus` / `play-pause` / `step` / `scrub` / `reset`). Planned cases (`tl-f1-duration-events`, `tl-f2-compare-eras`) require new contract fields — propose in SPEC before implementation.
